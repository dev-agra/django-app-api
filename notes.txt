github actions is similar to CI/CD and Jenkins

uses:
deployment
linting
unit testing

working:
triggers-> push to github
setup jobs-> run when triggers are hit
output i.e. a job is success or not

charged per minutes

configure github actions
-> create a config file
-> configure docker hub auth

Docker hub:
base images
pull images from docker
rate limits
100 images / 6hrs
auth users 200 pull images/6hrs

github actions uses shared ip thus configure with docker hub
so 200 pulls are to us and us only

so how to authenticate?
-> register with dockerhub
-> use docker login
-> add secrets to projects[variables to projects]
